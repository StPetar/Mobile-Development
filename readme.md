Additional Info: 
Currency ratios are updated automatically on app startup or with a press of a button in the additional options on the top right


App #2: Music Player

Additional Info:
The app searches your storage and inputs all available mp3 files in a queue.
The songs are played in a random order
Optional task was to use Google Maps API to create tiny zones (50-150m in diameter) for each new song you play.
When walking into the zone the song for the given zone would be played.
